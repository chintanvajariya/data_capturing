# Double Screen Grabber

## Purpose
In this day and age, any data-collecting hardware will come with packaged software assistance, without which the hardware is moot. Unfortunately, one of these products, the specifics of which I won't mention, allows for the collection of data but requests thousands of dollars to pay for its recording. In other words, if we want to analyze the 2e- ARPES' pressure values, we must waste precious grant money. Without going into too much detail, I brought up the idea of scraping the screen on which the app displays this pressure information, and that's how this program was born.

## How do we use it?
Because both of the time of flight chambers have different pressures, we needed to be able to collect both readings at the same time; hence the *double* screen grabber. As outlined in the following video, you just select the parts of the screen that must be read and the program does the rest.
